# Okapi Reference

Okapi is a library for PROS that is intended to ease development through wrapper and convenience functions.

The [okapi docs](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/v5/okapi/index.html) provides a more comprehensive reference -- this is just for our commonly-used functions.

## Enable

Uncomment the line `//#include "okapi/api.hpp"` in `include/main.h` so that it reads `#include "okapi/api.hpp"`.

We will use the line `using namespace okapi;` to automatically namespace calls for further convenience.
