Many of you are new to Git and Github, so I'll provide a brief introduction here.

# Background

Git is the most widely used version control software, initially developed by Linux Torvalds, who also created the Linux operating system. As version control software, it is a tool to easily manage changes in code like the "Revision History" feature of Google Docs.

GitHub provides hosting for Git, putting Git on the cloud. Github created Atom, which is what the PROS editor is based on.

As an analogy, Atom and the PROS editor are like the editing box of Google Docs; Git is the revision history. Combining these two provides offline Google Docs for code. GitHub is a company which puts this all online and provides more collaboration tools, such as Teams.

We're going to be using Github rather than, say, copy-pasting code into Docs or storing the code in Drive because it is *designed for code*. It is convenient once you learn the basics, and it is *built in* to Atom.

## Git Tutorial

To learn the basics of Git, I would recommend [The Coding Train's excellent tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY). Even professional developers have trouble with some of the finer points of Git, but Daniel Shiffman explains everything so well. Based on titles, I would suggest going in the order 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.6. Once you get more comfortable with git through practice, look at 1.9, 1.4, 1.5, 1.10, and 1.7 for more detailed information. 1.8 is  irrelevant to our application and relates to hosting websites through GitHub.

# Usage

For using Git with PROS, see the [Git/Github with PROS Reference](git-reference.md).
